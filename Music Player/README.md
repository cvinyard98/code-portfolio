# Overview

This project is a very simple mp3 music player. 
It can play music files from a given folder, pause and resume a song, skip to the next song, and go back to a previous song.
It displays the file name of the current playing song.

# Development Environment

This project was programmed in Visual Studio Code.
I used the arcade, vlc, and os libraries for the user interface, mp3 file playing, and file manipulation respectively.
