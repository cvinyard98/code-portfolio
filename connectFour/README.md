# Overview

In this project I recreated the game Connect Four. 

I wanted to demonstrate what I've learned about the C++ language in a fun and interesting way.

Connect Four seemed like an acomplishable challenge.

# Future Work

* I need to add error handling if users input something outside of the desired range.
* I want to add a 1 player mode playing against the computer. This could have difficulty levels from random moves to some sort of strategy.
* I could print the board out more nicely.
